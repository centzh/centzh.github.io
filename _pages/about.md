Hello! Welcome to my website. I am currently a graduate student studying an MPhil in Machine Learning and Machine Intelligence at the University of Cambridge. I’m interested in researching robustness, fairness and explainability in machine learning, with a view to improving decision-making in high stakes settings such as healthcare, education and policymaking. I completed my Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Sydney.

Before joining Cambridge, I was a Data Scientist and Policy Adviser at the Tech Council of Australia. As the lead analyst on the research team, I produced data-driven research to inform government policy on issues facing the tech sector. As a Policy Adviser, I led policy development on AI governance and regulation.

Before the Tech Council, I was a Research Intern at the University of Sydney’s School of Computer Science, where I focused on AI in education and computer vision research and a Software Engineering Intern at CSIRO Data61, the AI arm of Australia’s national research agency and Gradient Institute, an Australian AI safety research institute.
